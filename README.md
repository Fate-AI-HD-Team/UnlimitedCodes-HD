# IMPORTANT NOTICE
 ## Since this is a fork from Threule, it use hash = quick, which seems give problems replacing textures, skipping the memory location for Models in battle and Arcade mode faces give some issues. I'm looking if requires change hash to xxh64. Is occurs, current texture pack will be reworked entirely to fit new memory location, and maybe require a separated pack for USA/Europe version.
